Paper title: A Hybrid Cellular Automata Model Integrated with Deep Learning for Dynamic Spatio-temporal Land Use Change Simulation

Authors: Weiran Xing, Yuehui Qian, Xuefeng Guan, Tingting Yang and Huayi Wu

Codes description: The codes contain 2 parts, namely, CNN_features_extraction, model_prediction. The parameters set in each part should be carefully chosen since they are related to the characteristics of the study region. Therefore the proposed algorithm can be effectively applied to different study region.
